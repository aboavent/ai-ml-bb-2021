# Predicting Airline Delays using Sagemaker

## Introduction
The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Using this data we would like to predict Flight delays

## Project Goals
Your mission is two-fold. 
- Demonstrate how to use Spark for ETL and feature engineering on the input data. This will be the airline data and the *optional* Noaa data
- Leverage Sagemaker for model training and hosting

## Data sources
- On-time reporting data: You can download the zip by year/month
  - https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?DB_Short_Name=On-Time&Table_ID=236


- Extra credit : Combine with weather data from NOAA to build a better model
  - https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/
  - https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/by_year/

## Machine Learning Method
There are multiple ways to approach this. 
- Classification to predict flight will be delayed or not
- Regression to provide a probability of a delay
- Ensemble learning using Random decision forests

## Presenting Results
Tenets
- Clearly defined Project Goal
- ETL strategy and why?
- Modeling strategy - describe the process of selecting the right model
- Path to production

Artifacts:
- PPT
- Code/Notebook walkthrough

Extra points
- Run a live demo with a custom UI 
- Using the NOAA weather
