# Day 1

## DATA ENGINEERING
Data Engineering workshop has hands-on lab and modules focus on ingestion, hydration, exploration, and consumption of the data lake in AWS. This workshop allows hands-on time with AWS big data and analytics services including Amazon Kinesis Services for streaming data ingestion and analytics, AWS Data Migration service for batch data ingestion, AWS Glue for data catalog and run ETL on Data lake, Amazon Athena to query data lake and Amazon Quicksight for visualization. This workshop helps to build a cloud-native and future-proof serverless data lake.
