### MLOps
*Solutions:*

* [AWS MLOps Framework Solution](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/aws-mlops-framework/): This is a one-click to deploy solution published in the *AWS Solutions Library*  that creates a pre-configured pipeline. 

*Labs/Workshops:*
* [Built-In-Algorithm - Simple Pipeline](/1-Built-In-Algorithm/README.md): Simple pipeline to train and deploy a model built using SageMaker's XGBoost built-in-algorithm along with CodePipeline, CloudFormation, StepFunctions & Lambda. 
* [Built-In-Algorithm - Cross Account](/3-Built-In-Algorithm-Cross-Acccount/README.md): Cross account pipeline to train and deploy a model built using SageMaker's XGBoost built-in-algorithm along with CodePipeline & Lambda. 
* [Bring-Your-Own-Algorithm - Simple Pipeline](/2-Bring-Your-Own/README.md): Simple pipeline to build a SageMaker compatible docker image, then train and deploy a model built using scikit along with CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CloudFormation, StepFunctions & Lambda. 
* [Built-In-Algorithm - Jenkins Pipeline](/4-Built-In-Algorithm-Jenkins/README.md): Simple Jenkins pipeline to train and deploy a model built using SageMaker's XGBoost built-in-algorithm.
